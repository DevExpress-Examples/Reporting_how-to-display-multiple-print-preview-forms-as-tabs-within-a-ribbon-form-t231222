# How to display multiple Print Preview forms as tabs within a ribbon form


This example demonstrates how to show multiple report print preview forms within a single ribbon form. We create an MDI application by using <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraBarsDocking2010DocumentManagertopic.aspx">DocumentManager</a> with the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/CustomDocument11355.aspx">Tabbed View</a> applied and show Preview forms as MDI child elements. <br />Ribbon Control, which belongs to the MDI container (the ribbon form) has the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraBarsRibbonRibbonControl_MdiMergeStyletopic">MdiMergeStyle property</a> set to <strong>Always</strong>, so a child RibbonControl is <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument3451">automatically merged with a parent RibbonControl</a>. <br /><br />See also:<br /><a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument1199">Ribbon, Menu and Docking</a> <br /><br />
